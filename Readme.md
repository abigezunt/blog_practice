##GITHUB CLASS REPOSITORY

GitHub is a popular developer tool, and we want you to be familiar with it. GA is all about learning by doing, so in order to learn how to use GitHub we are going to use it during nearly every part of the course.

On the first day of class, you should clone this repo.

From the terminal, clone by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_BOS_1.git
```

Verify you added the remote by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

We know it takes time to get familiar with GitHub so here are a few quick tips:

###How Do I Get Files From GitHub?

For each lesson the instructor will post slides, exercises and, solution files. To get these files, __pull__ (download) them from the instructor's repository (upstream).

From the terminal type:
(make sure you are in the correct directory)

```bash
git pull origin master
```
